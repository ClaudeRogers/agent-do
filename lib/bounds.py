"""Bounds — the caps a command ships, and where each one came from.

The contracts layer already holds one abstract property across 95 tools without
anyone remembering to: every verb declares which beats it performs. This module
adds the second property. A command that caps its output declares where the cap
came from, and the declaration is checked against the quantity authority rather
than believed.

Four sources, and the source picks which enforcement applies:

  registry   the cap IS a published ceiling; `ref` is an authority key and the
             shipped literal must equal it exactly. A copy that differs is stale.
  derived    the cap is computed from a ceiling; `ref` is an expression over
             authority keys and the shipped literal must equal what it computes.
             The factor in the expression is the explanation.
  measured   the cap is counted at runtime; no literal may be shipped at all,
             because a counted quantity is true only now.
  none       no ceiling governs this number — it is a caller-facing default.
             Exempt from the capacity checks, and only from those: the audit
             still requires the output to carry its total, and any truncation
             marker to carry magnitude.

Detection is evidence-based, never prose-based. A command is bounding because a
numeric literal sits in a bounding position in its implementation, at a file and
line this module will print — not because its description sounded like it might
return a lot of rows. The same scanner runs outward over any project, which is
the point: one detector, two directions.

    Every model record pairs a capacity (`max_input_tokens`, everything the
    model may hold) with a delivery ceiling (`max_tokens`, the most it may hand
    back in one response). That pair is a published statement, by the people who
    built the system, about how small a single delivery is allowed to be
    relative to the space it is drawn from. Take the minimum over every record
    and you have the tightest such ratio anyone in the authority has committed
    to in writing.

    A declared bound that *claims a ceiling governs it* and lands below that
    ratio is smaller than any delivery ceiling any provider considered worth
    publishing — so its stated factor is doing no work, and the number came from
    somewhere other than the ceiling it cites. That is the `inject at 6000 chars
    against a 200k-token window` shape, and it is what this floor catches.

    The number is READ, never written: it is recomputed from models.yaml on
    every run and moves when the authority moves. Nothing in this repo stores
    it. It applies only to bounds whose declaration asserts a ceiling
    relationship (`registry`, `derived`) — a `source: none` bound claims no
    relationship, so there is no ratio to judge, and the audit holds it to
    carrying its totals instead.
