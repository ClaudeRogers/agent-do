# agent-do handoffs

This directory is generated workflow state. `.manna/` owns status, tracks,
claims, and blockers. Each actionable Manna item owns exactly one Markdown
work order here, and the two are content-bound.

Rules:

- Create work through `agent-do manna create`; do not hand-build parallel
  prompt roots such as `.handoffs/`, `.dev/session-prompts/`, or
  `<campaign>/handoff-prompts/`.
- The Manna item `prompt` field points to `.handoff/mn-xxxxxx-<slug>.md`.
- Frontmatter identifies the item, track, source, base commit, scope, inputs,
  and SHA-256 binding for the complete document.
- Edit a work order, then run `agent-do manna handoff seal mn-xxxxxx` before
  claiming it. A claim fails closed on any unsealed change.
- Board state stays in Manna. The handoff contains scope, authority,
  deliverables, and verification, never a second backlog.
- Commit `.manna/workflow.yaml`, `.manna/issues.jsonl`, and `.handoff/`.
