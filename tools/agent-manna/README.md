# Manna

> Git-backed issue tracking and context management for AI agents

Manna is a compact issue tracking system designed specifically for AI agent workflows. It provides issue tracking with dependencies, session-based claims for multi-agent coordination, generated handoff work orders, and context injection for AI prompts.

## Overview

### Why Manna?

Traditional issue trackers (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues) are designed for human workflows. Manna is designed for **AI agents**:

- **YAML output** - Machine-readable, LLM-friendly format
- **Session-based claims** - Prevents multiple agents from working on the same issue
- **Context injection** - Generates context blobs for AI prompts
- **Git-backed** - JSONL storage that diffs cleanly in version control
- **Fast** - All operations complete in <100ms

### Features

- **Full issue lifecycle commands** for tracks, items, dreams, and dependencies
- **Dependency tracking** with blockers
- **Session management** for multi-agent coordination
- **Generated `.handoff/` work orders** with bidirectional board linkage
- **Fail-closed claims** when an item's handoff contract drifts
- **File locking** for concurrent safety
- **Corruption recovery** for partial writes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.70+)
- Cargo package manager

### Build

```bash
cd /path/to/agent-do/tools/agent-manna
cargo build --release
```

The Rust binary is `manna-core`. The wrapper resolves `target/release/manna-core`,
falls back to `target/debug/manna-core`, and can also use a `manna-core` binary on
`$PATH`.

### Verify Installation

```bash
./agent-manna --help
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize manna in current directory
agent-do manna init

# Admit an existing nonempty board into strict pairing
agent-do manna migrate

# Create an issue
agent-do manna create "Fix authentication bug" "Users can't login with SSO"

# Derive dense priority names and the board index
agent-do manna sync

# List all issues
agent-do manna list

# Claim an issue to work on
agent-do manna claim mn-abc123

# Mark as done when complete
agent-do manna done mn-abc123

# Generate context for AI prompt
agent-do manna context
```

## Commands

### `init`

Initialize `.manna/` and the tracked `.handoff/` work-order root in the current
location. New or empty boards receive strict workflow version 2, board-owned
`.manna/handoff-order.yaml`, and a generated `.handoff/README.md`. Existing
nonempty legacy boards are classified explicitly and left unchanged. Strict
mode is pinned independently in `.manna/board.yaml`; deleting the workflow
config cannot turn validation off. Local ignore rules are narrowed so
the board and work orders remain Git-visible while the runtime lock stays
ignored.

```bash
agent-do manna init
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
initialized: true
path: .manna
workflow: strict
workflow_version: 2
handoff_path: .handoff
gitignore_updated: false
recovered_transactions: 0
upgraded_items: 0
restored_config: false
```

### `migrate`

Explicitly admit a nonempty legacy or mixed board into strict workflow version
2. One authenticated write-ahead transaction establishes the board identity,
creates and seals canonical handoffs for every legacy active item, annotates
done rows as grandfathered history, exempts tracks and dreams, and releases
claims that lack ownership proofs. Existing strict pairs are verified and
passed through byte-for-byte with their seals and ownership intact. A legacy
Markdown work order under `.handoff/` is adopted in place: migration wraps its
original contents in canonical frontmatter and required sections instead of
discarding it. Partial legacy frontmatter and old Claim sections remain inert
work-order content; only the canonical Claim section is authoritative. Active
description-first pointers may append ` — <note>` after the Markdown path;
that note remains row context and is never treated as part of the filename.
If an earlier migration admitted that malformed pointer, rerunning `migrate`
adds the exact source and provenance to the existing sealed handoff without
discarding its authorized body, then rebinds the row through the same journal.
Active
absolute pointers inside the project are normalized to repository-relative
provenance. An absolute pointer outside the project may import one regular
UTF-8 Markdown file when the file itself is not a symlink and the resolved path
does not enter Git metadata; its original path is recorded in the sealed
handoff. Imported source bytes are authenticated
separately from any target bytes the transaction may replace. Once those exact
bytes exist in every consuming sealed handoff, an in-project source outside
`.handoff/` moves to a deterministic
`.handoff/.archive/legacy-sources/*.source` evidence file in the same journaled
transaction. Cross-project sources remain untouched. Rerunning `migrate`
repairs boards admitted before source retirement existed while preserving
unaffected strict row and handoff bytes. Unique
hand-numbered prefixes seed first-class priority once; `manna sync` owns every
name afterward. Board identity is published last, so interruption leaves a
recoverable journal instead of a half-strict board. Repeating the command after
success is a byte-stable no-op.

```bash
agent-do manna migrate
```

Ordinary strict writes never invoke migration and retain the same fail-closed
pair, ownership, Git visibility, and symlink checks. A row carrying a strict
handoff digest remains strict even if someone deletes its document binding;
`migrate` refuses that tampering instead of adopting or resealing it.

### `status`

Show current session status and claimed issues.

```bash
agent-do manna status
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
session_id: ses_abc123
claimed_issues:
  - mn-def456
```

### `create <title> [description]`

Create a new issue. On strict boards, each actionable item also creates a
repository-relative `.handoff/<mn-id>-<slug>.md` work order and stores that
path in the issue's `prompt` field. A write-ahead transaction makes the row and
file recover as one pair after interruption. The transaction is HMAC-bound to
the canonical project root, complete rows, filename, canonical paths, and
payload, then installed with atomic no-clobber semantics.

```bash
agent-do manna create "Fix login bug"
agent-do manna create "Implement feature" "Full description here"
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issue:
  id: mn-abc123
  title: Fix login bug
  status: open
  created_at: "2026-01-29T10:00:00Z"
  updated_at: "2026-01-29T10:00:00Z"
  blocked_by: []
```

**Constraints:**
- Title: 1-500 characters

### `order <id> <position>` and `sync`

Priority is an ordered ID list in `.manna/handoff-order.yaml`. Move an item to
a one-based position, or converge presentation after any other board mutation:

```bash
agent-do manna order mn-abc123 1
agent-do manna sync
```

Both paths use the native recoverable rename transaction. Sync assigns dense,
board-wide fixed-width priorities with a two-digit minimum (`01..N`) and
expands the whole plan at 100 or more items (`001..N`). It derives the single
same-width blocker launch gate from the highest-numbered still-open blocker,
repoints every moved row, and regenerates `.handoff/README.md`. Dependencies
remain in `blocked_by`; filenames are never authority. Claimed handoffs do not
move, and their current number stays
reserved until release. Completed pairs return to unnumbered sealed history on
sync, so every bare numbered handoff remains a truthful launch signal.

```yaml
success: true
changed: true
renamed: 3
ordered_items: 8
held_claimed: []
```

### `claim <id>`

Claim an issue for the current session. Sets status to `in_progress`.

```bash
agent-do manna claim mn-abc123
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issue:
  id: mn-abc123
  title: Fix login bug
  status: in_progress
  claimed_by: ses_test123
  claimed_at: "2026-01-29T10:05:00Z"
```

**Notes:**
- Claim validation and the status change happen under one board lock, so one
  issue has exactly one winner under contention
- Attempting to claim an already-claimed issue returns an error
- Strict claims verify the board identity, Git visibility, symlink-safe path,
  structured frontmatter, exact Claim section, and whole-document SHA-256
  binding
- After claim, only the pinned `claimed_by` session may mutate or close the row

### `done <id>`

Mark an issue as completed.

```bash
agent-do manna done mn-abc123
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issue:
  id: mn-abc123
  title: Fix login bug
  status: done
```

### `abandon <id>`

Release a claimed issue without completing it. It returns to `open` when clear
or remains `blocked` when unresolved blocker edges remain.

```bash
agent-do manna abandon mn-abc123
```

`done` and `abandon` reject every session except the current owner. `done` also
provides the explicit unclaimed close transition for a parked dream, because a
dream cannot be claimed.

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issue:
  id: mn-abc123
  title: Fix login bug
  status: open
  claimed_by: null
```

### `block <id> <blocker_id>`

Add a blocker dependency. The issue's status becomes `blocked`.

```bash
agent-do manna block mn-abc123 mn-def456
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issue:
  id: mn-abc123
  title: Implement feature
  status: blocked
  blocked_by:
    - mn-def456
```

### `unblock <id> <blocker_id>`

Remove a blocker dependency. If no blockers remain, status reverts to `open`.

```bash
agent-do manna unblock mn-abc123 mn-def456
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issue:
  id: mn-abc123
  title: Implement feature
  status: open
  blocked_by: []
```

### `list [--status <status>]`

List issues with optional status filter.

```bash
agent-do manna list
agent-do manna list --status open
agent-do manna list --status in_progress
agent-do manna list --status blocked
agent-do manna list --status done
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issues:
  - id: mn-abc123
    title: Fix login bug
    status: open
  - id: mn-def456
    title: Implement feature
    status: in_progress
    claimed_by: ses_test123
```

### `show <id>`

Show full details of an issue.

```bash
agent-do manna show mn-abc123
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
issue:
  id: mn-abc123
  title: Fix login bug
  description: Users can't login with SSO
  status: open
  created_at: "2026-01-29T10:00:00Z"
  updated_at: "2026-01-29T10:05:00Z"
  blocked_by: []
  claimed_by: null
  claimed_at: null
```

### `handoff seal <id>`

Bind an intentional edit to the board. The command preserves the handoff body,
normalizes authoritative frontmatter, computes the canonical document SHA-256
with the self-referential binding field normalized,
and updates the paired `handoff_digest` transactionally.

```bash
agent-do manna handoff seal mn-abc123
```

Until sealing succeeds, `claim` fails closed. A comment containing a claim
command is never a handoff.

### `update <id> [metadata]`

Update title, description, type, track, source, or a legacy prompt pointer.
Strict item metadata updates first verify the existing seal, then propagate
authoritative frontmatter without approving body edits. Item conversion attaches or
archives the handoff transactionally. `update --status` is rejected; use the
lifecycle verbs `claim`, `done`, `abandon`, `block`, and `unblock`.

### `delete <id>`

Delete a row. On a strict board, Manna archives the paired handoff under
`.handoff/.archive/` and removes the row through one recoverable transaction.

### `context [--max-tokens <n>]`

Generate a context blob for AI agent prompts. Default max tokens: 8000.

```bash
agent-do manna context
agent-do manna context --max-tokens 4000
```

**Output:**
```yaml
success: true
context: |
  # Manna Context

  ## Open Issues (2)
  - mn-abc123: Fix login bug [open]
  - mn-ghi789: Add tests [open]

  ## In Progress Issues (1)
  - mn-def456: Implement feature [in_progress, claimed by ses_test123]

  ## Blocked Issues (0)
```

### `serve [--open] [--json] [--port N]`

The human window: a read-only cockpit on `127.0.0.1:7777`. `/` is the estate
(every registered board with needs-you / working / here); `/<name>` is one
board:

- **three tabs** — `inbox` (every ask, one shape per row: who/what · the ask ·
  the verb you perform: grant, fix, rule, split, close, read, launch),
  `board` (now / next / waiting, chips `live · +done · dreams · track`, a
  `list | timeline` switch), `coordination` (needs you, peers with what they
  hold, claims with contention, drops)
- **inspector** on the right: the item's manna title and description, blockers
  and dependents, claimant with pulse, trailer commits, one-click copy of the
  handoff path, id, and `show` command; or a peer's session, pulse, holdings
- **status strip** at the bottom: drift (live `reconcile --json`, read-only)
  and the daemon's health; `debug ▸` opens the sheet with every finding
- **⌘K / jump**: sheets, items, peers, other boards
- **digests**: each row shows a one-line digest of the item (fast model,
  hash-keyed cache under `$AGENT_DO_HOME/manna/serve/digests/`, regenerated
  only when title or description change, title as fallback); the manna title
  stays in the inspector. Set `AGENT_DO_SERVE_AI=off` to keep titles only.

Finish: ledger density on a 12px floor, one-line rows, zebra, a severity
stripe leading each row, outlined state pills, prompt headers (`$ manna next`),
raised-row selection. Ratified through four wireframe rounds (2026-08-24).

```bash
agent-do manna serve            # register this board, start the daemon if needed, print the URL
agent-do manna serve --open     # same, and open it
agent-do manna serve --scan ~/Projects        # register every board below a directory
agent-do manna serve --decision-marker "[NAME]"   # a leading title tag that means "a human must rule"
agent-do manna serve --status | --stop
```

Agents never read from it: `context`, `list`, and `show` remain the contract.
Private claim proofs (`claim_token_hash`) never leave the board directory.
Implementation: `serve/serve.py` (daemon, registry, two-clock cache),
`serve/board.py` (pure derivation), `serve/digest.py` (digests), beside the Rust core.

## Architecture

### Storage

Manna stores canonical board state in `.manna/` and durable work orders in
`.handoff/`:

```
.manna/
├── issues.jsonl     # Issue records (one JSON per line)
├── sessions.jsonl   # Session event log
├── board.yaml       # Independent strict or legacy identity
├── workflow.yaml    # Strict workflow version and handoff root
├── handoff-order.yaml # First-class ordered item priority
└── transactions/    # Ignored crash-recovery journal
.handoff/
├── README.md        # Generated workflow contract and index
├── NN...[bMM...]-mn-*.md  # Fixed-width priority and launch-gate presentation
└── .archive/        # Retired work orders
```

**Why JSONL?**
- Simple, human-readable format
- Git-friendly (line-based diffs)
- No database dependencies
- Easy corruption recovery (skip malformed lines)

### ID Format

Issues use hash-based IDs:

```
mn-{6-hex}
```

Examples: `mn-abc123`, `mn-f4e5d6`

IDs automatically extend (7, 8, ... chars) on collision.

### Session Management

Claim ownership uses two pinned environment variables:

- `MANNA_SESSION_ID`: public session label stored as `claimed_by`
- `MANNA_SESSION_TOKEN`: private bearer token of at least 32 characters; only
  its SHA-256 digest is stored in the board

Lifecycle mutations fail closed when either value is absent. Session hooks pin
both across shell invocations. Codex and other hosts that expose an opaque
runtime identity derive the proof under a machine-local key outside the
repository. Scripted lanes and plain shells must export both explicitly. A
visible owner label alone cannot complete, abandon, or edit its claim.

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| 0 | Success | Command completed |
| 1 | User error | Invalid input, issue not found |
| 2 | System error | I/O error, lock failed |

### Concurrency

All write operations use file locking (`fs2` crate):
- Exclusive locks prevent concurrent writes
- Unique no-follow temp files plus atomic rename for board updates
- Atomic create-if-absent installation for pair journals and private keys
- Safe for parallel agent execution

## Integration

### With agent-do

Manna is registered in agent-do's registry:

```bash
agent-do manna <command> [args]
```

### Session Hooks

Use with agent-do hooks for automatic session tracking:

**SessionStart hook:**
```bash
export MANNA_SESSION_ID="ses_$(uuidgen)"
export MANNA_SESSION_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

**PreCompact hook:**
```bash
CONTEXT=$(agent-do manna context --max-tokens 2000)
# Inject $CONTEXT into AI prompt
```

### Scripting

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create issue and capture ID
output=$(agent-do manna create "Automated task")
id=$(echo "$output" | grep -o 'id: mn-[a-f0-9]*' | awk '{print $2}')

# Work on it
agent-do manna claim "$id"
# ... do work ...
agent-do manna done "$id"
```

### Design Principles

1. **Minimal** - <5K LOC total
2. **Git-friendly** - JSONL diffs cleanly
3. **Agent-first** - YAML output, no colors/spinners
4. **Robust** - Atomic lifecycle mutations plus recoverable row/file transactions
5. **Simple** - No database or async runtime; explicit board and workflow identities
6. **Fast** - <100ms for all operations

## Troubleshooting

### "Storage not initialized"

Run `manna init` in your project directory:
```bash
agent-do manna init
```

### "Issue not found"

Verify the ID with:
```bash
agent-do manna list
```

### "Issue already claimed"

Another session has claimed this issue. Check who:
```bash
agent-do manna show mn-abc123
```

Only the owning pinned session can finish, abandon, update, block, unblock, or
delete claimed work. If that session is provably dead, use `manna reconcile
--fix`; do not impersonate its ID.

### Binary not found

Build the Rust binary:
```bash
cd /path/to/agent-manna
cargo build --release
```
